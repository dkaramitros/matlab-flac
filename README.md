# Readme
This repository includes a set of useful Matlab Functions to manage FLAC files. FLAC (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua) is an explicit finite difference code developed by [Itasca CG](https://www.itascacg.com/).

## flacHistories

function [titles,data] = flacHistories(input_file,output_file)
% This function opens the history file "input_file" from FLAC.
% The histories are read automatically, including a common x-axis.
% The titles are returned as the single row cell "tiltes".
% The data are returned as the multi row matrix "data".
% If an "output_file" is given, everything is exported for future use.

## Notes

Other functions will be added in the future.

**Enjoy!**
